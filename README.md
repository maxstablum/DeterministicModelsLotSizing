# Deterministic Models for Lot Sizing

## Description
The "Deterministic Models for Lot Sizing" project is focused on developing an application that offers a user-friendly interface to calculate the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Wagner-Whitin algorithm. This application aims to provide an efficient solution for lot sizing in production and inventory management.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: Version 21.0.1
- **React**: Version 18.2.0
- **NodeJS**: Version 20.10.0-LTS
- **Visual Studio Code (VSC)**: Version 1.85.0
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Version 11.0.10
- **Libraries**:
  - Axios: A lightweight yet powerful JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It simplifies sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and handling responses. Axios is known for its easy-to-use API and supports common HTTP operations like GET, POST, and DELETE. It provides features like request and response interceptors, cancellation of requests, and automatic JSON parsing. This makes it a flexible choice for managing API requests in web applications.
  - RESTful API: RESTful APIs are architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. They are used to define set of functions which developers can perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH
  - Spring Boot: A part of the Spring framework which is an open source application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
  - Spring Web: Integrated into Spring Boot, it provides tools for creating web applications, including RESTful applications using Spring MVC. It offers a powerful and flexible foundation for building web applications and services.
  - Maven: A project management and comprehension tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built and its dependencies.
